OTS PROJECT:
	I have implemented a Web Based Oil Transaction System which can serve three types users i.e. Client, Trader, and Manager. A client can buy/sell oil directly, depending on his current oil reserves, or contact a trader to perform 
these transactions for him. Based on each transaction, client pays commission to the company in form of either oil or cash.
	There are certain levels are available for clients based upon their purchase. It starts with SILVER and changes to GOLD, if they purchase 30 barrels in a single month. Commissions are applied as per their levels and their oil reserves or account balance are adjusted accordingly.
	OTS database keeps track of all the records of each transaction. Client can pay money to the company from time to time to settle their balances. A Trader can cancel certain payments and oil transactions, but these cancellations are logged for audit purposes. Payments and cancellations must go through traders only, not through anyone else. 
	A manager(administrator) is also a trader and has all functionalities available to a trader. Additionally, a manager can also view reports which gives him a brief analysis of various trades of the OTS system.
